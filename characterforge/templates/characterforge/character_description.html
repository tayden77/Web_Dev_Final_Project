          This is your chance to breathe life into your Dungeons & Dragons character. Beyond the stats and combat abilities, your character is a story waiting to be told. Here, you can shape their physical appearance, personality traits, and the rich tapestry of their past.
        </p>
        <small>
          <p class="mb-1">
            Physical Traits: Describe your character's appearance - from the color of their eyes to their hair and skin. Each feature adds depth to who they are in the world of D&D.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-1">
            Backstory: Every hero has a past. Your character's backstory is a narrative of their life before adventuring. Where did they grow up? What events shaped their path? This story can include family history, significant life events, cherished memories, or personal motivations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws: Flesh out your character's depth with ideals they strive for, bonds they hold dear, and flaws that make them imperfectly human (or elf, dwarf, etc.). These elements add layers to role-playing opportunities.
